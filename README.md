# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews

The main objective of this project is to create a model that will determine whether a Restaraunt review is Positive or Negative.

The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle and has been uploaded in this repository.

In this project, I used Natural Language Processing on the dataset 

The sentiment analysis is a classification because the output should be either positive or negative. I used the Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm in this project for classification.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of a feature. Bayes theorem calculates probability P(c|x) where c is the class of the possible outcomes and x is the given instance which has to be classified, representing some certain features.

P(c|x) = P(x|c) * P(c) / P(x)

Naive Bayes is mostly used in natural language processing (NLP) problems. Naive Bayes predict the tag of a text. They calculate the probability of each tag for a given text and then output the tag with the highest one.
